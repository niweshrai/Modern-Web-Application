John Clayton Mayer is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer.[2] He was born in Bridgeport, 
Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but disenrolled 
and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi 
Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs—refining his skills and gaining a following. 
After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia 
Records, which released his first EP, Inside Wants Out. His following two full-length albums—Room for Squares 
(2001) and Heavier Things (2003)—did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the 
Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single "Your Body Is a Wonderland".

Though Mayer started his career mainly performing acoustic rock, he began moving towards the blues genre that 
had originally influenced him as a musician. By 2005, he was collaborating with blues artists such as B. B. King, 
Buddy Guy, and Eric Clapton. Forming the John Mayer Trio, he released a live album in 2005 called Try!, and his 
third studio album Continuum in 2006. Both albums received wide critical acclaim, and Continuum earned Mayer a 
2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Waiting on the World 
to Change". That album was followed by Battle Studies in 2009, a return to pop, with a number-one grossing tour.

Though Mayer started his career mainly performing acoustic rock, he began moving towards the blues genre that 
had originally influenced him as a musician. By 2005, he was collaborating with blues artists such as B. B. King, 
Buddy Guy, and Eric Clapton. Forming the John Mayer Trio, he released a live album in 2005 called Try!, and his 
third studio album Continuum in 2006. Both albums received wide critical acclaim, and Continuum earned Mayer a 
2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Waiting on the World 
to Change". That album was followed by Battle Studies in 2009, a return to pop, with a number-one grossing tour.

John Clayton Mayer is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer.[2] He was born in Bridgeport, 
Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but disenrolled 
and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi 
Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs—refining his skills and gaining a following. 
After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia 
Records, which released his first EP, Inside Wants Out. His following two full-length albums—Room for Squares 
(2001) and Heavier Things (2003)—did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the 
Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single "Your Body Is a Wonderland".
